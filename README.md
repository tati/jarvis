### Make your own J.A.R.V.I.S. in Ruby

```
Level: Beginner
Time Estimate: 2 hours (???)
Topics: hashes, strings, if statements, while loops
```

###Project Brief
You are Tony Stark about to make your very first version of JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System)!
Your personal assistant will greet you, follow commands (such as `burp`!) and say
goodbye when you turn them off. Although these initial commands will be
quite simple, it will be very easy to build this project to add more
advance features (think of having JARVIS telling you the current weather
based on your IP address!). This is an excellent project if you are
completely new to Ruby.

###Milestones
1. Have JARVIS greet you upon running your file `puts "Hello Tony!"`

2. Take user input and turn it into a string using `gets.chomp`

3. Add commands! You can have JARVIS sing a song or read you a haiku!

4. Add a way to quit your program (if you need a temporary way while you
   fix this just use Control-C to exit the program)

BONUS:
Use a bash `say` command to use your computer's audio capabilities!
   (To use bash commands in Ruby just wrap them in back ticks `````

###Sample Solution
[JARVIS 1.0](https://github.com/tati/jarvis/blob/master/initialize.rb)

####NOTES:
- need to add more resources
- need a code review on the example
