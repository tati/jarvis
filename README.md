### Make your own J.A.R.V.I.S.

Level: Beginner
Time Estimate: 2 hours (???)

###Project Brief - TATI FIX THIS

Build your own JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) assistant!

This section describes the project to the student. Set the stage. Is
there a scenario for this project? Maybe the student should imagine they
are working for NASA to solve problems in space. Or maybe they're
working for Google to serve you more ads... Be creative in providing the
context of real project with a tangible outcome.

The brief should also explain precisely what the final product does. If
there's a visual output, show an example of what it could look like; if
not describe it in clear terms, such as "The student will enter the URL
/jedi/beyonce/knowles and the server will respond with Hello KnoBe." The
student should know what the end goal is by reading your description.

You may include some description of bonus extensions of the product â€“
creative ways students could extend the basic project. These are
optional, but help to allow some room for students to put their own spin
on a project.

###Milestones - TATI FIX THIS
1. Break down the project into "Milestones." At each "Milestone" the
   student should complete a  chunk of the project. For example, the
header for the first milestone section should be "Milestone 1: Build
your Server and Get it Running." A project could have anywhere from 1-4
milestones. 
2. For projects that are intended for the beginner level, steps should
   be specific and in a numbered list. For advanced projects, general
steps should give the student just enough information to get going.
3. If there's a skill a student needs to know in order to complete any
   part of the project, provide a link. For example, the last sentence
of a step might read: "If you need help with either step, review [Simple
Express servers and Request
parameters](https://courses.thinkful.com/node-001v4/assignment/2.1.1)."
4. If you included suggestions for a stretch milestone, make sure to
   include steps labelled as "Bonus Milestone: ..."

###Additional Resources - TATI FIX THIS
- For an excellent overview of Ruby see [Why's (poignant) Guide to
  Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/)

- The resources section should links to readings or videos that provide
  context or help the student build the project. Each resource listed
should have 1-3 sentences explaining what the resource is and why it's
useful.
- When linking to resources, you can link to Thinkful course content or
  content we've licensed (a list of available content can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zgx5ObMFN3Xl8Q3ZozLvfz6SN-yPXjvnmt4FGEnn2ts/edit#gid=0).
You can also use any resources from around the web, such as a
particularly helpful blog post, although prioritize content we provide
as we can guarantee their quality and reliability.
